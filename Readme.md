# CSS System Colors Demo

CSS System Colors have been around since

## Introduction

CSS System Colors are a set of 17 color keywords that are derived from the
user's operating system's color scheme. They are useful for creating a
consistent look and feel that matches the user's preferences.

The colors are defined in the CSS Color Module Level 4 specification and can be
used in any property that accepts a color value. They are prefixed with the
system- keyword, such as system-highlight or system-buttonface.

The colors are designed to adapt to different light/dark modes and contrast
settings, making them ideal for creating accessible and user-friendly
interfaces. They can be used in combination with other color values to create a
harmonious color palette. Note that the colors may vary depending on the user's
operating system and browser settings. A nice feature of CSS System Colors is
that they can be used in combination with other color values to create a
harmonious color palette. You just specify 'one' color, but the actual displayed
color will depend on the user's operating system and browser settings!

Some colors are deprecated as they enable mimicking system colors too well, and
could be used for fake, evil phishing sites!
